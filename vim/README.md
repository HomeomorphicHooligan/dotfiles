In this folder I will store all the **configuration files** that have relation with my **Vim text editor**. Vim is a very configurable console text editor, so it has different files that you can use to modify. You can learn more about Vim [here](https://www.vim.org/).

As an operating system, I use [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io), so some of the settings in this repository **may not work the same on different Linux distributions** or even on different operating systems.

I use **Vundle-vim** as a plugin manager, you can read more about Vundle-vim in its GitHub [repository](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). You can also use another package manager like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

Vim is made up of multiple files. **I have only uploaded to this repository those that I have configured to my liking**. Let's imagine a basic file structure on linux. With vim, it would be something like this:
```
home/<user>
| ...
| .vim/
| | autoload/
| | bundle/
| | views/
| | netrwhist
| .vimrc
```
You can check the structure of vim with a simple
```shell
ls -la
```
In this repository we have uploaded the following Vim files:
| File | Description | Position |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `.vimrc` | The main configuration file for Vim | The root directory `~` |


<h2 align="center">Set up</h2>

You can set up this Vim configuration to your local machine. But you will need some **requisites**. Although Vim is 
| Name | Version |Use | Links |
|------|---------|----|-------|
| Git  | n       | CLonning this repository | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |
| Vim  | 8+      | The Vim text editor itself | [vim.org](https://www.vim.org/) |
| Bash | 3.2+    | Running the setup | [gnu.org/software/bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) |

Although you can download VIM on [windows](windows.com) / chrome OS systems, this repository does not provide a secure way of installation for these systems, simply for those based on [Unix](https: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix).
Open a terminal and **run the following command**:
```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pblcc/dotfiles/main/vim/setup.sh)"
```
###### Note: This setup.sh file is still in development and may generate some errors.

I use the [dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) theme for vim. It's a dark theme with pastel colors.

The font I use is fira code bold. You can check it at [this repository](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).
