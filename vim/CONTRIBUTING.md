# How to contribute?
In this repository I'm uploading **my personal Vim configuration**, so pull requests about the configuration itself will not be merged. If you want to propose a change in the configuration you can **open an issue** using [this](https://github.com/PabloCorbCon/vim-config/issues/new) link.
However you can **contribute to this repository** if you want to change things that are related to:
* The `setup.sh` file
* Testing in other distributions / Vim versions
* Typos in the repository
* Improve the repository in a visual way
* `.github`configuration
