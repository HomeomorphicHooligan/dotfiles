# Dotfiles
Hi, I'm Pablo Corbal√°n, a high-school student and programmer at my own, In this repository I'm going to share all my configuration files (dotfiles), we call this files
dotfiles because they start with a dot (for then to be invisible). For example `.myconfiguration`. If you have any doubt about any of my files report an issue or check out my [social media](https://linktr.ee/pablocorbalann)

### Index
- [termux](termux/)
- [vim](vim/)
- [zsh](zsh/)

There are some other files that are not located in those folders, they are in the root of the repo, but you don't need an index for them :)
